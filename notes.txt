1. npm install express nodemon cors

2. create server.js
    check to see if the server is listening = type "nodemon server.js" in the terminal. 
    write 2 calls that we are going to call from the front end to the back end and get a response from our server

3. App.js
    const get data function. 
    add in package.json " "proxy": http://localhost:5000 "
    useState to create the buttons

End... I started out installing express, nodemon, cors. Then, created server.js where the server stuff is
        Then created the getData() in app.js.


/// SQL, Node, Express, and React JS 1/2 | ~How to Connect it all together (2nd video)
1. ssms
    start ssms as usual. connect with regurlar default (windows authentication)
    create new database. new query to create new table.
    I ran into a wall here. I am using my work laptop and my home laptop to do this project because I want experience with the details of
    git -merging between collaborators on a project- That means I need to share a database. I have been trying to allow SQL Server
    so I can share a databasse between my machines, but, have not gotten it to work. Im going to continue on with this tutorial. I will
    try to work that out at the end.
    So in order to make sure that we can configure a user on node.js to access the sql server:
        msssm > object explorer > connection > security(not the security that in nested in the databases) > logins,
        create a Loin Name
        select SQL Server authentication
        Password
        confirm password
        uncheck enforce password policy
        click ok
        go back to security > User Mapping > 
        check SQL tutorial, check db_owner, public. These will give us read and write permissions to the database
        Could not get it to connect had to do this:
            Server (Right Click) -> Properties -> Security -> Server Authentication -> select SQL Server and Windows Authentication Mode.
2. mkdir dbFiles, dbConfig.js, dbOpertion.js
    dbConfig:
        config file

    dbOperation.js:
        npm i mssql --save

3. server.js
    added dbOperation = require
    commented out: const API_PORT  down all the way to the end of 2nd call
    added: dbOperation.getEmployees().then
    add in package.json: "server": nodemon server.js /// I don't know why I had to add this
